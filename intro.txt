1. Scene opens up with a gridline-styled horizon that is classic of 80s retro art, set against a starry neon sky. 
Vapourwave-esque synth music begins to play in the background, slowly building up.

2. Suddenly, a cool, digital Tron-like vehicle (a sleek race car or a motorcycle) blazes in from the left 
side of the screen, trailing neon lights. As it zooms past the screen, the name "mov" is left behind in a glowing, vibrant neon script.

3. No sooner than the name solidifies, a second vehicle zooms in from the right side, 
this one a futuristic flying craft, leaving a similar neon trail in its wake. 
As it disappears off the screen, the name "himpu" appears in glowing, vibrant neon script.

4. The third name "Greatest$PAG" is then revealed in a bit more dramatic way. From the horizon, 
a large, digital spaceship rises, its lights illuminating the grid. As it ascends to the center 
of the screen, it sends out a shockwave of light, leaving behind the name "Greatest$PAG" in the middle of the screen.

5. After a moment, the spaceship disappears into the sky, leaving a trail of 
pixelated sparkles that coalesce to form the team name.

6. The team name is written in bold, metallic 3D letters that rotate and then fly towards the screen. 
The background starts to vibrate and flicker with each letter flying towards the camera.

7. Finally, a bright, all-consuming digital sunrise (the bright light) comes from the horizon, 
causing the grid to shatter and dissolve, as the camera starts moving towards it, accelerating.

8. The screen goes white as we 'enter' the light, signaling the end of the intro scene and 
transition into the next scene.
